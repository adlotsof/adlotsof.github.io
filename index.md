## Beginner android dev learning everything at the same time
- problem-orientated
- in love with details
- patient, but always choosing the quick fix

### Focussed on solving problems while learning as much as possible

All apps featured on this page solve real live problems. All apps on this page include a lot of concepts that are new to me - from material textLayouts till properly overwriting hashcode(), everything here solves two purposes:

-to learn as much as possible 
-to solve a real live problem

### Details make everything

As i learn all about software engineering while solving problems, a lot of times the specifications are very different at the end of the developement process compared to the specifications i had in mind when starting the project. A lot of times i lean a new concept and then implement that concept in some part of the project - nevertheless i take pride and joy in overhauling a complete project just to work better.

### Releasing means solving problems

Still not every release will be perfect - as a real problem is not getting solved by refactoring code for the third time, but by having a working product. A quick fix is often the solution you might find in a early release - but a project is never finished before its not perfect.
