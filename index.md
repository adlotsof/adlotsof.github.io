# Tim S
## Future Pro Developer

- problem-orientated
- in love with details
- patient, but always choosing the quick fix

### Focussed on solving problems while learning as much as possible

All apps featured on this page solve real live problems. All apps on this page include a lot of concepts that are new to me - from material textLayouts till properly overwriting hashcode(), everything here solves two purposes:

- to learn as much as possible
- to solve a real live problem


### Details make everything

As I learn more about software engineering, each project grows. The solutions i had in mind when starting a new project usually don't end up in the finished app, as i learn new concepts and new solutions while pushing each project forward. Stil, I take pride in overhauling each detail, each class and each method to perfection.

### Releasing means solving problems

Still not every release will be perfect - as a real problem is not getting solved by refactoring code for the third time, but by having a working product. A quick fix is often the solution you might find in an early release - but a project is never finished before it's not perfect.
