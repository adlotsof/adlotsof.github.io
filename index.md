# Tim S

## DevOps and Java Student
### - seasoned with some web experience -

- problem-orientated
- in love with details
- patient, but always choosing the quick fix first

### Problem - Solver

All apps featured on this page solve real live problems. All apps on this page include a lot of concepts that are new to me - from material textLayouts till properly overwriting hashcode(), everything here solves two purposes:

- to learn as much as possible
- to solve a real live problem

### Details make everything

As I learn more about software engineering, each project grows. The solutions i had in mind when starting a new project usually don't end up in the finished app, as i learn new concepts and new solutions while pushing each project forward. Stil, I take pride in overhauling each detail, each class and each method to perfection.
